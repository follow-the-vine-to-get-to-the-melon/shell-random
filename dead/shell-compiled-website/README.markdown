I did some very early experimentation with shell which might be lost in the earliest commits of the now ruby-compiled-website.

This was some experimentation in a time when I wasn't happy with ruby anymore, had begun the mythryl-compiled-website and couldn't get anywhere with it.

As of 2013-12-09, the ruby project works enough that I can make revisions again, and mythryl has been on ice for a very long time.
