Spread out the various parts of each file, so I only process the appropriate stuff if there is a certain sort of change.
For example, if I create a new document, I can search through all others and convert plain text into a link to that new document.
There is no sense in parsing through the header or footer, or certain other material.


The last step should be to bundle everything with the header and footer.

All markup will be trivially easy to understand.

Open with metadata, defining a template.
