  #   You almost certainly don't want to delete keymap main.  To create a
  #   completely new keymap, create one with "bindkey  -N", giving it a new name,
  #   then you can add to it as much as you want while it's not selected.
  #   *Then* use "bindkey  -A" to make "main" a link to your new keymap.
  #   (And presuming that you want to save the keymap permanently, use "bindkey -L"
  #   to dump the keymap in the form of the commands needed to poulate it.)
# bindkey  -N    foo  .safe
# bindkey  -A    foo  main
# bindkey  -L
# bindkey  -R    "^@"-"^I"      self-insert
# bindkey  "^J"  accept-line
# bindkey  -R    "^K"-"^L"      self-insert
# bindkey  "^M"  accept-line
# bindkey  -R    "^N"-"\M-^?"   self-insert

# A decent set..

# These notes are old.  things seem to be different now:
# FIXME - alt-backspace and ^backspace are both the same!
# So maybe somehow rig a function up to the backspace key to use some external program which can see if alt/ctrl were held down?
# Or better yet, I think I can have ~/.Xresources specify what the key does.  At the console, control-backspace is ^_, which is different from X.  Maybe I can force a different keycode to pop out with control-backspace in an xterm, and then I can have zsh pick that up and use it.  Check out the bottom of http://zshwiki.org/home/zle/bindkeys
# Also consider control-shift-backspace to delete to the beginning of the line

# I've uncommented only the things I required.  The above typeset seems to be good for most things.
